# Deep Learning-based Implementation of Telerobotic Control with Gesture Recognition from EMG Signals

This research explores the field of telerobotics, focusing on the remote control of a robot using Electromyography (EMG) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors. The aim is to enable precise control of a robot arm by capturing muscle responses or electrical activity through the Myo armband, an EMG electrode with an integrated IMU. The captured signals, representing hand gestures, are classified using a GRU + Attention model, allowing for seamless translation of gestures into robot commands. Training the model with online, self-collected, and combined datasets demonstrates its effectiveness. Feature extraction using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and representation via spectrograms enhance the model’s performance. The achieved accuracy rates of 94.62% (online dataset), 64.14% (combined dataset), and 63.33% (self-collected dataset) validate its proficiency. Successfully implementing telerobotics relies on the Myo armband’s ability to capture both EMG signals and IMU data, facilitating precise control over the robot’s end effector and movement through gesture recognition and orientation conversion.
